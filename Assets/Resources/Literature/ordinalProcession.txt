Life, without Math, is a complex, splitting field that is never well-ordered. If at any point you catch yourself overencumbered by illogical thoughts, use the Noumenon of Subset:



<color=blue>❶ Get real. (Well-orderedness)</color>
Choose which of your thoughts and Postulates can be found truly intrinsically, and reject which are the result of imperfect mechanisms, such as sight and hearing.

<color=blue>❷ Get rational. (Countability)</color>
Choose which of your actions would best benefit your intrinsic thoughts. It's often necessary to prevent an infinite continued fraction of thought by simply DOING instead.

<color=blue>❸ Get integral. (Next and Previous)</color>
Choose which group would best benefit your current actions. By integrating towards a group with the same goal, you can agree exactly what happened earlier and what to do next objectively.

<color=blue>❹ Get natural. (Base Case)</color>
Repeat the Noumenon until it becomes Trivial. Without loss of generality, this provides a base case for induction; erasing a nonpositive past, and succeeding quickly toward an Ordinal future.

<color=blue>❺ Get Ordinal. (Existence of Omega)</color>
Becoming Transfinite means to transcend the natural order. Simply find a limitation in your intrinsic nature and Prove its negation by contradiction. The Axiom of Infinity guarantees you can always find another limitation.

You will learn more once you regain the privilege of calling yourself a proud Mathmematician.
